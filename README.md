# BooLean
Open-source workout logger and planner.

Written in react-native and tested for iOS.

## Welcome

First off: yes, I know there are too many workout logging apps already out there! 

However, they generally suffer from at least one of the following issues:
- They are filled with adds or require expensive ongoing subscriptions to unlock basic functionality
- They are restrictive in the programming offered, usually confining the user to choose a preset routine rather than creating their own
- They are updated infrequently and since code is proprietry there is no way for users to take development into their own hands

In addition, the focus is usually away from collecting data over the long-term (i.e. years), the data is not necessarily easy to export in a usable format and the tools for analysis are often limited. Sad! 

The intention is for this app to provide a free-to-use, open-source alternative to what is available already, but with a particular focus on enabling users to collect data about their training that will help them gain insights and drive longterm progress.

It is very much a work in progress and it will likely be a while before a proper release version is available, so please bear with! 

Contributions are welcome!
